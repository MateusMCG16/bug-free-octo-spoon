# Matrix Rain & CharCam Project

## Project Overview

This project showcases a dynamic web application built with Next.js featuring two main interactive experiences:

1.  **Matrix Digital Rain (Homepage):** A visually engaging Matrix-style digital rain effect implemented using HTML5 Canvas. Users can customize the animation by:
    *   Adjusting the speed of the falling characters.
    *   Changing the color of the characters.
    *   Toggling an RGB rainbow mode for a vibrant effect.
    *   Reversing the direction of the rain (characters falling up or down).
2.  **Character Cam (`/chars` page):** An innovative feature that uses your webcam feed and renders it in real-time as ASCII-like art using a set of special characters.

The application also includes an "About" page (`/lorem`) providing more details on these features.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

First, ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm/bun) installed. Then, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
